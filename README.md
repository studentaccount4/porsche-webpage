**Purpose of the webpage**

This project was developed to create an interactive and visually engaging Porsche-themed website, showcasing the brandâ€™s history, models, and innovations. The webpage was designed with a user-friendly interface, accessibility features, and interactive elements to enhance engagement and usability. Key features include:
- Fixed navigation bar
- Hero section with high quality imagery
- Interactive fun fact button for engagement
- Embedded Porsche history video
- Clickable Porsche model gallery linking to official website
- Contact form for user inquiries
The project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, following modern front-end development principles to ensure accessibility and interactivity.

**UI/UX choices**

To optimize user experience, several UI/UX design principles were implemented:
- Fixed navigation bar, ensures that users can quickly jump to sections without scrolling
- High-quality hero section, displays an impactful Porsche GT3 RS image with a drop shadow
- Clear typography & high contrast, improves readability and accessibility
- Interactive elements, dynamic fun fact button, various hover effects, and model links
- Semantic HTML & ARIA labels, enhances accessibility for screen readers and other technologies
- Fluid layout with CSS flexbox, ensures proper display on different screen sizes
These design choices create a modern, user-friendly, and visually appealing experience for all visitors.

**Challenges and how they were resolved**
- Navigation bar alignment: The navbar was misaligned on smaller screens, making it difficult to use. We resolved this using CSS flexbox and applied a backdrop blur effect for better readability.
- Hero image scaling issues: The background image was either cropped or had excessive padding on different screen sizes. We adjusted the CSS background-size and background-position to ensure proper scaling.
- Fun fact button bug: Clicking the button stacked multiple facts instead of replacing the previous one, leading to messy formatting. We fixed this by modifying the JavaScript event listener to replace the text instead of appending to it.
- Accessibility enhancements: Used semantic HTML elements and integrated ARIA labels to assist screen readers.
- Future improvements: Enhancements such as ReactJS integration, CSS keyframe animations, and CAPTCHA for form security would further refine the experience.
